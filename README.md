OpenXC Dock
===========

This repository is a part of the [OpenXC][] project.

This repository contains the documentation and open source design files for an
example OpenXC accessory that provides a generic I/O interface to add sensors
and actuators to a vehicle. The design was originally released by Ford.

This design has yet to be actually prototyped, so YMMV.
